                Methods of Breathing
                Deep diaphragmatic breathing: By triggering the parasympathetic nervous system, deep, slow breathing can lower tension and foster serenity.
                4-7-8 respiration: Take a 4-second breath, hold it for 7 seconds, and then let it out for 8 seconds. This promotes mental calmness and reduces anxiety.</p>

It is typically conducted by a guide or instructor, either in person or through recordings. It entails being gently guided through a sequence of visualizations, breathing exercises, and mindfulness practices that help you focus, relax, and achieve inner peace..</p>
